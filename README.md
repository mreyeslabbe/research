<b> Spatial Slum Growth, Immigration and Public Goods provision <br></b>
 <p align="justify">
Slum-dwelling is a common alternative for housing purposes in developing economies, which are also facing
massive international migration flows. Informal squatting is related to this phenomenon: in Chile, more
than 30% of slum-dwelling households are of international migrant origin. Nevertheless, slums are extremely
segregated, observing communities that are barely mixed in terms of migrant/native origin of their inhabitants.
This leads to the question of whether native and migrant population are complements or substitutes in the
<i>production function of slums </i>. By using a 2019-2023 panel dataset at the slum level and a TWFE approach to
estimate elasticities, I document that while the number of migrant and native households separately increase
the spatial extension of slums, when considering them jointly, a negative association is found, pointing to
migrant/native congestion effects. These results suggest immigration-induced slum expansion is more likely to occur at the extensive margin. As underlying mechanism, I explore
on the lack of communitary organization within slums, a public good requiring collaborative efforts between
migrants and natives to prevent eviction, develop transitory urbanization strategies, and advocate for formal
housing solutions. </p>
